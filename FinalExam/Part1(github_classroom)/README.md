# Student Registration System

For this task, you are to implement a simple student registration system consisting of three classes implemented in
three Python modules:

* The `student.py` module -- implements the `Student` class which keeps track of each student's ID and name.
* The `course.py` module -- implements the `Course` class which keeps track of a course's ID, name, and credits.
* The `regis.py` module -- implements the `Regis` class which keeps track of student and course collections, as well as
  students' enrollments in courses.

## Specification and Testing

Please refer to each module's documentation for its specification and testing.

* [`docs/student.md`](docs/student.md)
* [`docs/course.md`](docs/course.md)
* [`docs/regis.md`](docs/regis.md)
