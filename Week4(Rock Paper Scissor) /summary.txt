I have complete all project from Week 4 assignment including rock.py and board.py .

from Wk4assignment
I have done and got
- logic and systematic thinking 
- for loop and list sliceing indexing
- function and return multiple value and assign them

while I was writting a program There are many thing that I want to told about the assignment
- first I think you fixed function/step of thinking/algorithm to do it
- I think there such a way to write it and optimized the code rather than make some function that such a waste of time
(it can do shorter way and optimixed the solution due to the function you given)

Finally, From this assignment I have got more concept of systematic thinking, 
but i think It couldn't use reduntdant method to solve it, Just simple.

Thank you A.J. Supaporn.
