## Submission

You have to submit your code via GitHub Classroom.

## Grading Criteria

`Correctness (75%)`: Your program must pass all the doctests and give expected results.

`Cleanliness (25%)`: Your program must follow the PEP8 convention.  Variable names are meaningful.  Docstrings are written for all methods and functions.  Comments are added at certain points for others to understand your code easily.

## Your Task

There are six CSV files that you have to work with, Cities.csv, Countries.csv, Players.csv, Teams.csv, and Titanic.csv. 
Players.csv and Teams.csv are related to each other by sharing some attributes. Cities.csv and Countries.csv share some features as well.
Your tasks are about finishing all the functions in the following files:

`geography.py`		(read **Cities.csv** and **Countries.csv** files)

`football.py`		(read **Players.csv** and **Teams.csv** files)

`titanic.py`		(read **Titanic.csv** file)

All these files are, however, incomplete and it is your job to complete them. If you want to check your code, you can do so with `data_processing_run.py`.
