 I have complete all project from Week 6 assignment including theater.py and bts_fee.py .

from Wk6assignment
I have done and got
- logic and systematic thinking 
- Practice nested dict and while loop

while I was writting a program There are some thing that I want to told about the assignment
- I think you fixed function/step of thinking/algorithm to do it
- the way you fixed it a redundant method(some function and main part at bts_fee)  please try to dont do it next time

Finally, From this assignment I have got more concept of systematic thinking, while loop, and dictionary skll and more.
