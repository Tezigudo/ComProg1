The ability to speak does not make you intelligent.
In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.
Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering.
Your eyes can deceive you; don't trust them.
Try not. Do or do not. There is no try.
At some point, we all have to choose, between what the world wants you to be, and who you are.
No man can win every battle, but no man should fall without a struggle.
We let the fear of discovery stop us from doing what is right.
Your focus determines your reality.
We all know the truth: But in times of crisis, the wise build bridges, while the foolish build barriers.
Many of the truths that we cling to depend on our viewpoint.
Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.
Part of the journey is the end.
No amount of money ever bought a second of time.
It's not about how much we lost. It's about how much we have left.
Today we don't fight for one life, we fight for all of them.
It's not enough to be against something. You have to be for something better.
I choose to run towards my problems, and not away from them. Because that's that what heroes do.
