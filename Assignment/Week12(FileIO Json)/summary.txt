I have complete all thing on Wk12 assignment(that is account.py and database.py) with in a day xD.

The things that I done and get from this work is
- Learn what JSON file work and what it is
- working with JSON file.
- FileIO and exception handing
- using .gitignore to ignore file that Doesnt need
- get some skill to solve problem.(problem solving)

from this assignment I have got lots of Logic thinking.
I have done all and have some comment about it
1.) some function are redendant such as withdraw function
    it should return bool ever it is valid amount or not
    and check in transfer function

2.) I think you fixed solution to use,(fix วิธีทำมากเกินไป)

3.) long program must have a main part to run manually to see what go on.

4.) This program I didnt see what going on program, I onlys see if I pass doctest or not.

Thanks AJ. Withawat :).
